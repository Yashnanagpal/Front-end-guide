            <h1> WHAT IS FRONT-END?</h1>
            <p>The website's “front end”,or as some of those who are more technical refer to as the “client side,” is the part of the website that the users see and interact with.It includes everything that users experience directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and a navigation menu. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the languages used for Front End development.Responsiveness and performance are the two main objectives of the Front End. The developer must ensure that the site is responsive i.e. it appears correctly on devices of all sizes no part of the website should behave abnormally irrespective of the size of the screen.</p>
